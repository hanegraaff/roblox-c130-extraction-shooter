# Testing and acceptance

## Current foundation checks

Run `python3 scripts/setup.py` once for the pinned dependencies, then `python3 scripts/verify.py`. The verifier is the full non-Studio gate for the implemented development shell. It fails on missing tools, type/lint/format errors, test failures, empty required suites or leaked test content. Future plans extend this entrypoint as their behaviors arrive.

| Gate | Command used by the verifier |
| --- | --- |
| Repository inputs | `python3 scripts/check_repository.py` |
| Format | `stylua --check src tests scripts/run_tests.luau` |
| Lint | `selene src tests scripts/run_tests.luau` |
| Roblox sourcemap | `rojo sourcemap test.project.json --output build/sourcemap.json` |
| Strict types | `luau-lsp analyze --platform=roblox --sourcemap=build/sourcemap.json --definitions=@roblox=.tools/globalTypes.d.luau src tests scripts/run_tests.luau` |
| Unit rules | `lune run scripts/run_tests.luau unit` |
| Lifecycle integration | `lune run scripts/run_tests.luau integration` |
| Release/test builds | `rojo build default.project.json --output build/game.rbxlx` and `rojo build test.project.json --output build/tests.rbxlx` |
| Artifact isolation | `python3 scripts/inspect_build.py` |

Direct tool commands require `$HOME/.rokit/bin` on PATH; setup and verify arrange that internally. The [development guide](development.md) lists versions and installation requirements.

The standalone runner discovers `*.spec.luau` modules and emits JSON with `suite`, `discovered`, `passed`, `failed` and `skipped`. The current unit suites exercise finite numbers, flat bounded payloads, configuration and injected-time rate limits. Integration tests exercise the real lifecycle controller with controlled resource adapters. They load the production modules, not copies of their rules.

The verifier also copies source into disposable fixtures to inject a deliberately failing case and an empty unit suite. Both must exit nonzero with the intended diagnostic. A temporary strict-type fixture assigns strings to `Part.Anchored` and a number variable; analysis must reject it using real Roblox definitions. These are expected rejection probes, not shipped failing tests. The temporary fixtures are removed after the probes.

Artifact inspection parses the generated XML, checks the runtime-script allowlist and verifies the absence of test runners, TestEZ, fixtures and development overrides from the release DataModel. Update the allowlist deliberately when adding runtime modules. Build success and standalone tests do not establish engine behavior.

## Run the Studio smoke suites

1. Build with the full verifier. Open `build/tests.rbxlx` as a separate local Studio document, or sync `test.project.json` into a separate test place. Preserve any unrelated open place and unsaved work.
2. Through Studio MCP, list connected instances, select the intended test document and inspect its state. Consult the connected server’s relevant skill guidance. Confirm that `ServerScriptService.ServerTests`, `StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.ClientTests`, `ReplicatedStorage.TestPackages` and `ServerStorage.DevelopmentSettings` belong to the test mapping.
3. Start **Play** with one actual client for the P01 smoke gate. The mapped server and client runners execute TestEZ automatically. The server requires a player within ten seconds. Startup waits in the smoke specs are bounded; a missing report or timeout is a failure requiring investigation.
4. Read both structured JSON reports and the Studio Output log. In the **server** context:

   ```luau
   return workspace:GetAttribute("ServerTestReport")
   ```

   In the **client** context:

   ```luau
   return game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer.PlayerScripts.ClientTests:GetAttribute("ClientTestReport")
   ```

5. Each report must have `discovered > 0`, `passed == discovered`, and zero `failed`, `skipped` and `errors`. Report fields also include `suite`, `environment = "Studio"` and deterministic fixture `seed = 1`; the server adds actual `clientCount`, and the client adds its `userId`. Check actual contexts/client count instead of assuming a report proves a multiplayer session.
6. Stop Play and start it again. Collect fresh reports and verify one `ReplicatedStorage.BootstrapStatus` and one local `PlayerGui.FoundationStatus`, with no leftover `EntrypointStatus` or `EntrypointPanel`. The suites also exercise two explicit stop/start cycles of the server runtime and status controller.
7. Open `build/game.rbxlx` separately. Play, confirm an avatar spawns on the temporary platform and the panel reads **Development** / **Bootstrap running**. The test build reads **Test**. Review readability in the actual viewport and inspect Output. Stop Play when finished.

The server suite loads the shared unit/integration cases through actual Instance-based requires and checks bootstrap ownership plus a real raycast at the anchored spawn. The client suite checks replicated status, character availability and GUI/controller cleanup. P01’s one-server/one-client smoke does not prove gameplay replication between two players, combat, no-respawn rounds, camera feel, device compatibility or release capacity.

Do not manually invoke another TestEZ run while the automatic runners are active. Rebuild or sync after source changes and run a fresh Play session to avoid require-cache and stale-document ambiguity. Keep engine reports tied to the tested source tree and build hash; required engine gaps remain open even if the host gate passes.

## Required test levels

| Level | Purpose | Execution / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static | Format, lint, strict Luau types, module boundaries | Pinned tools in local/CI gate; Roblox-aware definitions for engine code |
| Unit | Rules: transitions, timers, damage, ammo, circular orbit math, weapon-linked zoom, single-launcher ownership | Standalone Luau under Lune; deterministic clock/random inputs |
| Service integration | Real services connected through fakes for transport, clock and world queries | Lune where engine-independent; TestEZ in Studio for Instance-dependent adapters |
| Engine integration | Raycast/cover, Humanoid death, collision swaps, Instances, camera state | TestEZ in the test place, with assertions and a structured pass/fail summary |
| Multiplayer | Replication, roles, input rejection, late joins, visibility, cleanup | Two distinct client contexts for gameplay claims; P01 only requires its one-client smoke; actual 6/10 capacity sessions arrive later |
| Experience | Readability, camera feel, sound, balance, fairness | Focused operated playtest and captured observations; supplements automated evidence |

Unit tests use observable invariants and boundary examples, not implementation-specific call order unless order is the contract. Integration tests use real services and fake boundaries, not fake services calling each other. Engine checks assert real world state. A client screenshot cannot establish server authority.

## Determinism and fixtures

- Inject the clock and seed; use a tiny map fixture with one exposed target, one solid wall, one breakable wall, a clear projectile path, circular map bounds and one launcher anchor.
- Include minimum/maximum population, a two-client development fixture, and seeded 10-player roster data. Ten fake player records do not count as ten network clients.
- Include source/target inside and outside every boundary, exact deadlines, duplicate messages, two launcher claims in one step, carrier death during reload, simultaneous aircraft/last-player destruction, disconnect/reconnect, and a stale projectile after reset.
- Every suite states which requirement it proves, which values are fixtures, and why tolerances exist. Keep random balance tests reproducible by printing their seed.
- Avoid real-time sleeps in rule tests. Engine tests may wait for bounded replication/physics conditions with explicit timeout and useful diagnostics.

## Core gameplay invariants

- With an undamaged plane and no rifle fire, direct rocket hits one and two leave it alive; hit three commits destruction and one ground win. A duplicated impact never counts twice. Misses/near misses do not count as direct hits.
- M-7 damage is positive and accumulates on that same health pool. Cover blocks shots, health never goes negative, and mixed rifle/rocket damage can require fewer remaining rockets.
- Exactly one launcher is available or held per round. Simultaneous claims, death/disconnect/drop, invalid-position recovery and reset cannot duplicate it or refresh reload early.
- The orbit follows the map perimeter at all sampled phases; camera look tracks map center while model heading follows the tangent. Both aircraft weapon FOVs keep targeting coherent, distinct and inward-facing.
- Rapid 30mm/105mm switching cannot reset weapon timers, refill ammunition or bypass reload. Rejected/stale selection restores the correct weapon/FOV/reticle combination.
- Deadline first, then aircraft destruction before ground elimination within the same pre-deadline step: test boundary/mutual-kill cases and late in-flight rockets explicitly.

## Negative network tests

For each mutating action, exercise malformed payloads, NaN/infinity, oversized data, unknown weapon/launcher IDs, unowned equipment, wrong role, spectator/eliminated state, excessive rate, stale round ID, repeated sequence, impossible range/origin and blocked line of sight. Assert rejection **and unchanged ammo/health/launcher-ownership/result state**. Valid traffic must still succeed after a rejected request.

Character movement is client-simulated in normal Roblox play. Include implausible travel/teleport requests around launcher pickup and ground firing origins; an authoritative proximity check alone does not prove a movement exploit is prevented.

## Studio execution and evidence

The explicit P01 server/client runners are mapped only by `test.project.json` and excluded from `default.project.json`. Use the Roblox Studio MCP connection as the primary way to inspect and operate the test place and supported playtests; identify the intended Studio instance and discover its actual capabilities first. If the required operation is unavailable, use documented Studio steps and a human-assisted run where possible. Do not claim that Lune or a generated place simulated a real server; an unavailable required engine check remains open.

Record for each required run:

1. Plan and tested source commit/tree, Studio version, test-place build, seed, map fixture and client count.
2. Suite names with discovered/passed/failed/skipped counts and useful output/log location.
3. Which assertions ran on the server versus each client; replication deadlines where relevant.
4. Reproduction steps and evidence for experience observations, including viewport and graphics settings.
5. Failures, limitations and whether the tested source changed afterward.

Keep concise text evidence under `docs/evidence/`; keep large logs/captures as linked CI artifacts or bounded repository assets. Never fabricate screenshots, live client counts or an experience URL. If a required engine check cannot run, finish independent work but leave the plan In progress or Blocked with the concrete missing access/evidence.

## Objective release budgets

These are initial engineering targets; P11 records a named reference desktop before measuring. Changing a budget needs a reason in the plan, not a quieter test.

- Test at 1920×1080 with a recorded graphics quality. Target client frame time p95 ≤33.3 ms for both roles during a scripted five-minute combat workload.
- Target server frame time p95 ≤16.7 ms for the same workload. Record the sampling method, active clients, projectile/cover/effect counts and Studio/cloud environment.
- Complete five consecutive accelerated deterministic rounds with no stale damage, launcher ownership, results, listeners or map state. Server-owned temporary instance/connection counts must return to the baseline after each reset.
- Run a 30-minute multiplayer soak. After warmup and equivalent reset points, retained memory growth must be ≤10%, with no monotonic leak; record actual samples and separate engine caches from owned allocations.
- Exercise a controlled latency scenario near 150 ms round-trip, recording actual simulator settings/measurements, and confirm state converges without duplicated damage/rewards.
- Run actual 6-player and 10-player sessions before release. Studio supports up to eight locally simulated clients per current documentation; use an authorized Roblox test experience for the ten-player case. Recheck the platform limit if tooling changes.

Budgets do not promise performance on unspecified hardware. If a target is missed, optimize or record a scoped design decision; do not mark the gate passed.

## Completion evidence template

Each plan already includes a record to fill. List criterion ID → test name/file → command/environment → observed outcome. Include final source commit, CI URL, Studio report, tester findings, documentation review and remaining limitations. Required checks left unrun remain incomplete acceptance criteria.

The [Roblox testing documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/testing-modes) is the source for actual Studio modes and simulated-client capabilities.
